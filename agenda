- DONE name table
- DONE name lookup
- DONE basic repl
- DONE proper tail calls
- DONE add primitives for allocating stuff in data mem
- DONE add allocating stuff in dictionary
- DONE untangle build system
- DONE sequence allocation
  - DONE: current scheme of directly increasing DP doesnt support
    nesting, replace with atomic allocation after read
- DONE: dictionary extension, DEFERRED: namestack
- DONE: apply counted strings to token reader
- DONE: reader nesting, involves making parsing explicit
- DONE: > remove dict entries and substitute with offset number from known ff-pointer array
    to allow for quick runtime word lookup (constant time)
- DONE: revamp ruby compiler, with dictionary support and syntax error reporting
- DONE: implement new literals
- DONE: compilation to graphs, inline recursive words not working yet
- support inlining tail recursive combinators
- support non-tail-recursive combinators (involves compiling the call to an "anonymous" function)
- stopworld mark-sweep gc (should only be triggered during user input,
  so not time critical)
